    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
      <span class="a"><b>Rajshahi City Corporation</b> was established as the Rajshahi Municipality
      (Rampur-Boalia Municipality) on August 1, 1876. A town committee of 7
      members led by a former principal of Rajshahi College was formed by the
      Government headquartered in Rajshahi College.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="b"> Most of the members were later replaced by the elected members. Only the
      tax-payers could attend the election. The administrator and the Medical
      Officer were also among the members of the committee. Beside this
      committee, there was also a Municipal Board.</span>
